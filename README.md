=============-- Hedgehog Barbershop by Brian Smyth --=============

===== - Introduction - ====

Overview

This website is for a central barbershop with a higher-income, sophisticated client-base. The atmosphere and history of the barbershop must be subtly portrayed with a new online presence but keeping with the old-style feel of the business.

Why does it exist

While there are many barbers in the city within a short distance, the skill and experience of The Hedgehog Barbers, partnered with the owners' professional and discrete approach ensures a long history of happy clients. This website is to introduce the establishment to new and younger fashion-conscious customers who have not yet visited the shop.

What does it do?

The site will be visual, with appealing pictures of the shop, the work-instruments, the team of staff and the gallery of customer's with different hairstyles. 

How does it work?

The landing page will contain a picture of the shop with a testimonial quote and an active CTA button to make an appointment. There will be a navigation bar for links to Home, Services, Experience and Contact page. 
The Services page will have a list packages available to the clients with a CTA button to make a booking. Bookings can be made using either the information in the Contact page or else using the Online Booking page feature. 

Who will benefit most from visiting the site

The site will be for both current clients and for attracting new ones. It must be easy to use and navigate for older visitors. It must be attractive to younger visitors to browse through. 
The main client-base who will benefit most from the barbershop site will be males, 16 years and up, wealthy background and living in an approximately 10 kilometer radius.  

===== - User Experience - ====

Visitors to the site will be made curious by the established barbershop. Prices will not be listed on the site as the clients are encouraged to call and make appointments and will receive the price, normally based on a minimum of 1-hour per visit. 
The first physical visit to the shop will portray to the client that it is not an express service but will offer a high quality well-groomed approach to personal styling. 

--Desktop View --

Each page will contain a logo-area in the top left screen which is the business name. There is no graphic or logo-design other than the text. 

A responsive navigation menu will sit to the top right of the screen.

Logo and navigation menu will be contained in a responsive row with a 4 and 8 unit column width therein.

Each page will contain a footer that will house only the site's associated Social Media links on the left and the address on the right of the screen.

The pages' background image will be an attractive image of a barbershop.

Landing page - index.html - will contain a client's quote as testimonial. 

Services page - services.html - will contain the main list of services.

The Experience page - experience.html -  will introduce the visitor to each of the three staff members and their approach to styling. It will also provide a respective link to each barber's YouTube video. 

The Contact page will contain an online form where the visitor can submit their name, email address and a message to the barbershop. The email is monitored regularly by the receptionist. The Contact page will also have a button to the Online Booking page, however clients are encouraged to ring directly. 

Tablet View

The tablet view will inherit most features of the desktop site but the navigation bar will respond by transforming into a Burger bar for a drop-down menu. This will feature in the top right.

The Burger bar, when activated will transform into a "X" that can close the menu again when required. This will be seated near the top right of the page.

Mobile view

On mobile phone devices, the nav bar will remain as an active Burger-style drop-down menu.

The Landing page gallery will shrink to a single column to scroll downwards.

==== - building the site - ====

The Navigation bar:

1. Logo & Navigation

These have been applied in a Bootstrap Container / Row / Column structure, with an initial 5 + 7 unit ratio for the logo and navigation bar.  

Rather than use a sourcecode template for the Navigation, I followed a video tutorial to gain the effect I wanted. Most were using Javascript or else were very basic or clumsy in appearance. I chose Navigation menu that will, for responsiveness, include a rotating menu icon with transitions to add extra life to the effect.

With Font-choice for the logo and menu, line-height increased dramatically from the original tutorial so paddings and margins were set differently to accomodate. The Hamburger icon was widened with further adjustments to the - Transform:TranslateY - settings to ensure the animated X kept a centered cross-over of the first and third bars (the middle one removed using opacity).

2. Footer 
2 x Col-Md-6 columns contain the Social Media details and the shop's address details respectively.
Font Awesome icons used to link the visitor to the shop's Social Media pages. 
The Shop's physical address is aligned to the right of the page. 

3. A picture of the shop is held as the background hero-image. 

4. The visitors eyes are drawn to a testimonial quote and to an active button directing to the contact screen. 

5. The services page contains a hero-image of antique scissors sets, with the list of services in the front, also containing a button to book now. 

6. ** README file had to be repeated as the original was accidentally wiped yesterday. New file saved 26/11/2020.
